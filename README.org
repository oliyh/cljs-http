  A HTTP library for [[https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript][ClojureScript]], forked from https://github.com/r0man/cljs-http and adapted to return promises instead of channels.

** Differences to cljs-http

- Returns a promesa promise (extension of native js/Promise) instead of a channel
- The `:cancel` option is now a promesa promise
- The `:progress` option is now a function that will be called on each update
- The `cljs-http.core/abort!` function has been removed
- The `:channel` option has been removed
